## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

**Problem**: Delayed response due to approval bottlenecks
**Solution**: Pre-approve template responses and establish clear escalation authority. Create emergency approval protocols that bypass normal processes.

**Problem**: Inconsistent messaging across channels and stakeholders
**Solution**: Maintain single source of truth for key messages. Use central crisis communication hub and require all messages to use approved templates.

**Problem**: Social media response overwhelmed by volume
**Solution**: Implement automated response acknowledgment, scale customer service team, and use paid promotion to amplify official responses.

**Problem**: Legal team blocking necessary communication
**Solution**: Involve legal counsel in crisis planning phase to pre-approve response frameworks. Establish risk tolerance guidelines for crisis communication.
