**Solution**: Involve team in strategy development process. Create clear connection between individual roles and strategic objectives.

**Problem**: Market conditions change mid-year invalidating strategy
**Solution**: Build quarterly strategy reviews and scenario planning. Maintain 15-20% budget reserve for strategic pivots.
