## Core SDR Automation Framework

### 1. Intelligent Lead Routing System

**Automatic Lead Distribution:**
```
ROUTING LOGIC:
IF lead_score >= 80 AND company_size = "Enterprise" 
   → Route to Senior SDR within 5 minutes
IF lead_score >= 60 AND product_interest = "Premium"
   → Route to Specialist SDR within 15 minutes  
IF lead_score >= 40 AND timezone = "Business Hours"
   → Route to Available SDR within 30 minutes
ELSE
   → Queue for next day assignment

LOAD BALANCING:
- Track SDR capacity: max 20 active prospects each
- Account for time zones and availability
- Consider SDR skill level and specialization
- Monitor response times and adjust routing

ESCALATION RULES:
- No response in 1 hour → Notify SDR manager
- No contact in 24 hours → Reassign to backup SDR
- 3 failed attempts → Move to nurture sequence
```

**Implementation Setup:**
- **CRM Integration**: Salesforce/HubSpot workflow automation
- **Scoring Model**: 15 data points weighted by conversion probability
- **Real-time Alerts**: Slack/Teams notifications for hot leads
- **Performance Dashboard**: Live SDR activity and conversion tracking
