**We fired our marketing team. This is what we're building instead.**

We lived that crisis. We hired the expensive agencies. We burned cash on "growth hacks" that went nowhere. We tried to play the game.

And we failed.

So we're building a new game. We're solving the problem with code.


## Welcome to the Autonomous Marketing Prompt Library 

And Thank you for your incredible interest in the AI-Automated Marketing Department.

This directory is the engine room of the Autonomous Marketing Engine (AME). 

It's a collection of carefully engineered prompts designed to replicate the functions of an entire marketing department, from high-level strategy to daily content creation.

We are turning marketing roles into a series of commands you can run. 

Each folder and file in this library represents a specific marketing capability. By using these prompts, you can execute complex marketing tasks without needing a traditional team.


## The Fully Automated Marketing Department & Autonomous Marketing Engine (AME)

This repository is building a future where marketing is not managed and executed by people, but by a system. We are creating a fully autonomous marketing department composed of AI agents, automated pipelines, and executable playbooks. Our goal is to replace every traditional marketing function. From C-suite strategy to creative execution - with AI, Agents and Code.


We are building an open-source answer to the closed, expensive "agentic" platforms being developed by tech giants like Salesforce and HubSpot. While they build walled gardens, we're giving the keys to everyone.

The traditional marketing organization is a complex ecosystem of human expertise. We are systematically designing AI to automate nearly every task.

## The Mission: An Autonomous System

The mission isn't another "copilot" to help your existing team work faster. This is the replacement for the team itself.

The Autonomous Marketing Engine (AME) is a new paradigm designed to build and run your entire go-to-market strategy on autopilot.
