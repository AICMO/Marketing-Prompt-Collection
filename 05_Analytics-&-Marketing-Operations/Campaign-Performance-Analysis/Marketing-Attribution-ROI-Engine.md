## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

**Problem**: Attribution models show conflicting results
**Solution**: Use ensemble approach with multiple models, validate with incrementality testing, and establish model confidence intervals.

**Problem**: Long sales cycles make attribution difficult
**Solution**: Implement view-through attribution windows, use predictive analytics for in-flight opportunities, and track micro-conversions as leading indicators.

**Problem**: Cross-device tracking gaps in customer journeys
**Solution**: Implement customer ID stitching, use probabilistic matching, and validate with survey data on customer behavior patterns.

**Problem**: Offline touchpoints not captured in digital attribution
**Solution**: Create unique campaign codes for offline channels, implement call tracking, and use survey attribution for events and PR.
