**Problem**: Executives want too many metrics on one view
**Solution**: Create layered dashboard with executive summary + drill-down capabilities. Limit top-level view to 5-7 key metrics.

**Problem**: Real-time data not available for all channels
**Solution**: Implement data refresh schedules and clearly label data freshness. Use predictive modeling to estimate real-time performance.

**Problem**: Team not using dashboard consistently
**Solution**: Build dashboard into weekly meetings, create mobile-friendly views, and add automated insights that require no interpretation.
